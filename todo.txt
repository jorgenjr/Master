PROGRAMMING
- Summarize all probe set values before Quantile Normalize -> Abbas
- What is the best way to simulate a mixture?
- Calculate Pearson Correlation for Abbas -> use for heatmap
- What do CIBERSORT correlate? The result, or tumor content?
- Check if differential expression is correctly produced
- See if CIBERSORT can generate own gene expression signature matrix with differential expression file (4 cell lines, no tumor content, no noise)

TEXT
- Flow diagram of the whole black box. Detect similar cell subsets
- Write about the heatmap vs. their tumor file
- Differential expression (write)
-- Using my cell lines to find out which genes are turned on.


STEP 1: *** DONE
- Did I quantile Normalize data before creating Signature Matrix?
-- Add tumor content to signature as well

STEP 2: *** DONE
- Increase tumor from 0% -> 99% for mixtures
-- Create BIG (no, many small) matrix

STEP 3: *** NEED TO RUN ABBAS
- Summarize all probe set values before Quantile Normalize -> Abbas

STEP 4: *** DONE (NEEDS MORE TESTING)
- Create a script which automates the process:
-- Simulation
-- Conversation
-- Run CIBERSORT
-- Run Abbas
-- ???
-- PROFIT

STEP 5: 
- Calculate Pearson Correlation for Abbas -> use for heatmap
- What do CIBERSORT correlate? The result, or tumor content?

STEP 6: *** DONE (CHECK WITH TREVOR IF CORRECT)
- Noise before Quantile Normalisation?
-- To control noise content control f

STEP 7: MAYBE
- Check if differential expression is correctly produced
- Generate a diffexp again
-- Convert affy to HUGO
- See if CIBERSORT can generate own gene expression signature matrix with differential expression file (4 cell lines, no tumor content, no noise)
-- Or is this CELL LINES?
