- Differential expression (write)
-- Using my cell lines to find out which genes are turned on.

- Write down about the GeoBank, etc. Why did I use it?
-- gene expression signature matrix method
- Convert Affy IDs to HUGO for the differential expression output file
- Run CIBERSORT with both simulation data and differential expression (?)
- IMPORTANT: DOES MY ALGORITHMS ASSIGN THE CORRECT GENE VALUE TO THE CORRECT GENE ID AFTER NORMALISATION ETC.?


Check out CIBERSORT command line
Check if differential expression is correctly produced
See if CIBERSORT can generate own gene expression signature matrix with differential expression file (4 cell lines, no tumor content, no noise)
