- Differential expression (write)
-- Using my cell lines to find out which genes are turned on.

- Convert Affy IDs to HUGO for the differential expression output file
- IMPORTANT: DO I CALCULATE THE TUMOR CONTENT CORRECTLY? IT LOOKS LIKE I MAY END UP WITH MORE CONTENT THAN I SHOULD.


Check if differential expression is correctly produced
See if CIBERSORT can generate own gene expression signature matrix with differential expression file (4 cell lines, no tumor content, no noise)
Generate my own gene expression signature matrix


PROGRAMMING
- Summarize all probe set values before Quantile Normalize -> Abbas
- What is the best way to simulate a mixture?
- Noise before Quantile Normalisation?
-- To control noise content control f
- Calculate Pearson Correlation for Abbas -> use for heatmap
- What do CIBERSORT correlate? The result, or tumor content?

TEXT
- Flow diagram of the whole black box. Detect similar cell subsets
- Write about the heatmap vs. their tumor file

STEP 1: *** DONE
- Did I quantile Normalize data before creating Signature Matrix?
-- Add tumor content to signature as well

STEP 2: *** DONE
- Increase tumor from 0% -> 99% for mixtures
-- Create BIG (no, many small) matrix

STEP 3:
- Summarize all probe set values before Quantile Normalize -> Abbas

STEP 4:
- Create a script which automates the process:
-- Simulation
-- Conversation
-- Run CIBERSORT
-- Run Abbas
-- ???
-- PROFIT
