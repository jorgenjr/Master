FILE STRUCTURE:
Abbas:
- Abbas_HUGO (lsfit, simulation -> HUGO)
- Abbas_result (lsfit, simulation (probes))
- Abbas_result_tumor (lsfit, simulation (probes) with tumor cell line in signature matrix)
- LLSR_HUGO (lm, ran with simulation/HUGO_tumor)

analyze_result:

convert:
- simulation_hugo_unique_tumor (simulation -> HUGO)

output:
- CIBERSORT_HUGOfirst_tumor (HUGO -> simulation, ran with HUGO_tumor)
- CIBERSORT_randomsignatureQ_tumor (running CIBERSORT with random signature genes (quantile normalized), ran with HUGO_tumor mixture)
- CIBERSORT_randomsignature_tumor (running CIBERSORT with random signature genes, ran with HUGO_tumor mixture)
- CIBERSORT_result (simulation -> HUGO, ran with convert/simulation_hugo_unique_tumor mixture)
- CIBERSORT_result_tumor (simulation -> HUGO, ran with convert/simulation_hugo_unique_tumor mixture and signature matrix with tumor cell line)

simulation:
- HUGO_signaturegenes (only genes in ???/221_signature)
- HUGO_tumor (mixture -> HUGO -> simulation?)
- mixtures_with_tumor (simulation with probes)



PROGRAMMING
- Summarize all probe set values before Quantile Normalize -> Abbas
- Check if differential expression is correctly produced
- Check normal distribution etc.

TEXT
- Flow diagram of the whole black box. Detect similar cell subsets
- Write about the heatmap vs. their tumor file
- Differential expression (write)
-- Using my cell lines to find out which genes are turned on.


STEP 3: *** NEED TO RUN ABBAS
- Summarize all probe set values before Quantile Normalize -> Abbas

STEP 7: MAYBE
- Check if differential expression is correctly produced
- See if CIBERSORT can generate own gene expression signature matrix with differential expression file (4 cell lines, no tumor content, no noise)
-- Or is this CELL LINES?

STEP 10:
- Check normal distribution etc.

STEP 11:
- LLSR is Abbas/lsfit
-- Read in Newman et al. about how they compared it.
-- See how they compare CIBERSORT to LLSR

STEP 12:
- Mixtures with 70% tumor content
-- Spike in 0% -> 10% cell line (IM-9 or Raji, since they're closely related)
-- Spike inn 0% -> 10% with two cell lines (IM-9 and Raji, discuss with Trevor)
- Calculate the differential expression for IM-9 and Raji, and e.g. Raji and Jurkat
-- Show that IM-9 and Raji are closely related!
- Try to randomly select 221 genes not present in the signature matrix and run LLSR and CIBERSORT
-- Repeat 10 times and produce average Pearson correlation
- Produce plots:
-- lsfit, lm, CIBERSORT and actual proportions for no noise or tumor content.

STEP 13:
'Results':
- (PLOT) Proportions of cell lines present in mixtures (LLSR, CIBERSORT and actual amount)
-- mixA_notumor.png
-- mixB_notumor.png
-- mixC_notumor.png
-- mixD_notumor.png
- Address which cell lines that are closely related by using diff. exp.

- (HEATMAP) Pearson correlation when tumor cell line is not present in signature matrix (LLSR and CIBERSORT)

-- LLSR: LLSR_heatmap_probes_newnorm_20x20.png

- (PLOT) Spike in Raji since GSE11103 contains two B-cell lines (LLSR, CIBERSORT and actual amount)

* Skip all plots and heatmaps with HUGO genes, explain that sufficient information was removed in the process.

STEP 14:
- Should I create a 'config' file instead of changing source code?
